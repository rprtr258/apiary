{"id":"apiary-1ba","title":"Fix eye button functionality in tab headers","description":"The eye button in tab headers currently doesn't work properly. It should hide all request parts of the tab pane and only show the response, but currently it only hides part of the request, doesn't change the icon properly, and subsequent clicks don't work.\n\nRoot causes identified:\n1. App.ts: Eye icon element is created once and never updated when signal changes\n2. RequestHTTP.ts: Has subscription logic but uses wrong element references\n3. Other request components: Missing proper signal subscriptions and layout updates\n4. All components: Need to handle dynamic layout changes when request is hidden","design":"## Implementation Strategy\n\n### Core Principle\nUse direct DOM manipulation (no framework) to:\n1. Update eye icon when signal changes\n2. Toggle request panel visibility \n3. Expand response panel to full width when request is hidden\n\n### Architecture Changes\n\n#### 1. App.ts - Eye Button Icon Update\n- Store eye button element reference\n- Subscribe to `show_request.sub()` \n- Replace icon SVG on signal change\n- Update title text on signal change\n\n#### 2. Request Components - Layout Toggle\nEach request component needs:\n- Store references to request and response panel elements\n- Subscribe to `show_request.sub()` \n- Update parent container layout on signal change:\n  - **True (show)**: Split view (request + response)\n  - **False (hide)**: Response only (full width)\n\n#### 3. NSplit Component Handling\n- Current NSplit creates fixed grid layout\n- Need to either:\n  - Replace NSplit with conditional layout, OR\n  - Hide/show panels within existing NSplit, OR  \n  - Use CSS to hide request panel and expand response\n\n### Component-specific Fixes\n\n**High Priority:**\n- RequestHTTP.ts: Fix subscription logic and layout\n- RequestSQL.ts: Add subscription and layout toggle\n- RequestJQ.ts: Add subscription and layout toggle\n- RequestMD.ts: Add subscription and layout toggle\n\n**Medium Priority:**\n- RequestGRPC.ts: Implement show_request support\n- RequestRedis.ts: Implement show_request support\n- RequestSQLSource.ts: Add proper subscription\n\n### Implementation Pattern\n```typescript\n// In each request component's loaded() function:\nconst requestPanel = /* element */;\nconst responsePanel = /* element */;\n\nshow_request.sub((show) =\u003e {\n  if (show) {\n    // Show split layout\n    el.replaceChildren(NSplit(requestPanel, responsePanel));\n  } else {\n    // Show response only (full width)\n    el.replaceChildren(responsePanel);\n    responsePanel.style.width = \"100%\";\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Testing Strategy\n1. Click eye button - icon should toggle\n2. Click eye button again - icon should toggle back\n3. Request panel should hide/show accordingly\n4. Response panel should expand to full width when request hidden\n5. All request types should work identically","acceptance_criteria":"1. Eye button icon changes between open/closed eye on click\n2. Eye button title updates between \"Hide request\" and \"Show request\"\n3. Clicking eye button multiple times works correctly\n4. When eye is closed, request panel is completely hidden\n5. When eye is closed, response panel takes full width\n6. When eye is open, split view is restored\n7. All request types (HTTP, SQL, JQ, MD, GRPC, Redis, SQLSource) work consistently","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-03T04:06:27.115405842+03:00","updated_at":"2026-01-03T04:20:37.440835138+03:00","closed_at":"2026-01-03T04:20:37.440835138+03:00","close_reason":"Closed via update"}
